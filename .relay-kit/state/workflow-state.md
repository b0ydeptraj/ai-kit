# workflow-state

## Current request
Add package publication workflow hardening so Relay-kit can produce a no-upload publish plan before package-index release.

## Active lane
- Lane id: primary
- Mode: serial
- Lane owner: Codex

## Active orchestration
- Layer-1 orchestrator: workflow-router
- Layer-2 workflow hub: fix-hub
- Active specialist: developer

## Active utility providers
- Primary utility provider: testing-patterns
- Additional utilities in play: evidence-before-completion

## Active standalone/domain skill
- Skill: developer
- Why selected: the next slice is a bounded commercial-readiness code change with a direct red-green test.

## Complexity level
- Level: L3
- Reasoning: package publication touches release evidence, version/channel policy, docs, support diagnostics, and CLI behavior.

## Chosen track
- Track: enterprise-flow
- Why this track fits: the slice hardens package publication evidence used for paid/team release claims.

## Known blockers
Package upload, marketplace publication, and legal SLA commitments remain external release actions outside the local repo gates.

## Escalation triggers noticed
Future work that changes package metadata, release artifacts, trusted manifest data, readiness gates, CI gates, or support diagnostics should remain on an enterprise-flow path.

- Bootstrap local verification: `python scripts\runtime_doctor.py . --strict --state-mode live`, `python relay_kit_public_cli.py doctor . --skip-tests --policy-pack enterprise`, and `python -m pytest -q --basetemp=.tmp\pytest-bootstrap-current-state-2` passed.
- Current branch: `codex/publication-plan-gate`.

## Recommended next lane
After this slice merges and CI passes, route through `workflow-router` to pick the next implementation slice. Highest-value candidates are dashboard/eval expansion or package publication workflow hardening.
