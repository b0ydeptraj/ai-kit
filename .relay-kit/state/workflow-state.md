# workflow-state

## Current request
Refresh live workflow state after PR #9 so the current source of truth matches main before the publication execution evidence lane.

## Active lane
- Lane id: primary
- Mode: serial
- Lane owner: Codex

## Active orchestration
- Layer-1 orchestrator: workflow-router
- Layer-2 workflow hub: fix-hub
- Active specialist: developer

## Active utility providers
- Primary utility provider: testing-patterns
- Additional utilities in play: evidence-before-completion

## Active standalone/domain skill
- Skill: developer
- Why selected: the next slice is a bounded state hygiene update after a merged dashboard/eval expansion feature.

## Complexity level
- Level: L1
- Reasoning: this pass updates live state and context only; runtime code is already merged.

## Chosen track
- Track: quick-flow
- Why this track fits: the slice removes state drift before the next feature lane.

## Completed artifacts
- [ ] product-brief
- [ ] PRD
- [ ] architecture
- [ ] epics
- [ ] story
- [ ] tech-spec
- [ ] investigation-notes
- [x] project-context
- [x] qa-report
- [x] team-board
- [x] lane-registry
- [x] handoff-log

## Ownership locks
| Artifact | Owner lane | Lock scope | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| none | none | none | none |

## Next skill
test-hub

## Known blockers
Package upload, marketplace publication, and legal SLA commitments remain external release actions outside the local repo gates.

## Escalation triggers noticed
Future work that changes package metadata, release artifacts, trusted manifest data, readiness gates, CI gates, or support diagnostics should remain on an enterprise-flow path.

## Recommended next lane
After this state refresh merges and CI passes, start the publication execution evidence lane.
