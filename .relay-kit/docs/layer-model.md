# layer-model

This repo follows a 4-layer hub-and-spoke topology so orchestration and execution are separate concerns.

## layer-1-orchestrators
Coordinate the whole system, choose the active lane, and keep shared state current.

- workflow-router
- bootstrap
- team
- cook

## layer-2-workflow-hubs
Run repeatable multi-step workflows and hand off to the right specialist or utility provider.

- brainstorm-hub
- scout-hub
- plan-hub
- debug-hub
- fix-hub
- test-hub
- review-hub

## layer-3-utility-providers
Stateless capabilities and analysis helpers. These should be called by hubs or orchestrators rather than acting as long-lived owners of work.
