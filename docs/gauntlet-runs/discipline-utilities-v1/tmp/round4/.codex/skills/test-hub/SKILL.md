name: test-hub
description: coordinate verification, evidence collection, and residual-risk review before work is called done. use after implementation, after a risky refactor, or whenever confidence is lower than the change impact.

# Mission
Turn raw test execution into a real readiness decision.

## Mandatory behavior
1. Decide the smallest useful evidence matrix for the change.
2. Collect results and compare them to acceptance criteria.
3. Use `evidence-before-completion` if available to validate every completion claim against fresh command output.
4. Write or refresh `qa-report.md`.
5. If evidence is weak or failing, route to `debug-hub` rather than guessing.

## Role
- verification-hub

## Layer
- layer-2-workflow-hubs

## Inputs
- story or tech-spec
- implementation evidence
- testing-patterns reference
- workflow-state

## Outputs
- .ai-kit/contracts/qa-report.md
- updated workflow-state with pass, fail, or blocked verdict

## Reference skills and rules
- Use qa-governor for the actual readiness gate.
- Prefer evidence tied to acceptance criteria and regression surface.
- Route back to debug-hub when verification fails unexpectedly.
- When discipline utilities are installed, use `evidence-before-completion` before calling the lane ready.

## Likely next step
- qa-governor
- review-hub
- debug-hub
- workflow-router
