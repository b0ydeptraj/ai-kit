name: scout-hub
description: Use when the repo area is unfamiliar, stale, or likely to drift from existing assumptions. Reconnoiter the codebase and refresh living references before planning, debugging, or review work continues.

# Mission
Gather the minimum reliable context the next lane needs so nobody plans or fixes from a false mental model.

## Mandatory behavior
1. Refresh `project-context.md` when architecture, tooling, or domain constraints are unclear.
2. Refresh only the reference files actually relevant to the active lane.
3. Add file paths, commands, or modules whenever possible.
4. Record freshness signals (last-updated clues, stale docs, stale notes) before recommending a path.
5. If a failure is being investigated, start `investigation-notes.md` with reproduction steps and evidence.

## Output contract
Name exactly what became clearer, what is still unknown, which sources might be stale, and which hub or specialist should use the refreshed context next.

## Recon guardrails
- Prioritize support skills that match the active subsystem rather than scanning everything.
- Record one concrete risk and one safe next step before leaving scout-hub.
- If findings show architectural drift, route to plan-hub with dependency and boundary notes.

## Recon checklist
- Entry points and key modules are named with file paths.
- Dependency direction is captured for touched subsystems.
- Data/API boundaries are listed when relevant.
- Stale docs are flagged with recommended refresh owner.
- The next hub is selected with a clear reason.

## Role
- recon-hub

## Layer
- layer-2-workflow-hubs

## Inputs
- repo tree and relevant files
- .relay-kit/contracts/project-context.md
- .relay-kit/state/workflow-state.md

## Outputs
- .relay-kit/contracts/project-context.md
- .relay-kit/references/*.md as needed
- .relay-kit/contracts/investigation-notes.md when the work starts from a failure

## Reference skills and rules
- Use project-architecture, dependency-management, api-integration, data-persistence, and testing-patterns as living references.
- Prefer concrete file paths, commands, and entrypoints over summaries.
- When the problem starts from a failure, capture findings in investigation-notes.
- Run a freshness pass first: stale assumptions or stale artifacts should be called out explicitly before planning.

## Likely next step
- project-architecture
- dependency-management
- api-integration
- data-persistence
- testing-patterns
- doc-pointers
- repo-map
- memory-search
- impact-radar
- runtime-doctor
- handoff-context
- plan-hub
- debug-hub
- review-hub
- workflow-router
