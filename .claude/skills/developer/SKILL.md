description: Use when planning is ready and code must be changed with controlled scope and evidence. Implement a story or tech-spec using the cleaned execution loop and project-specific support references.
---

# Mission
Turn an approved story or tech-spec into code and evidence without reopening solved planning questions.

## Mandatory behavior
1. Read the active story or tech-spec completely before changing code.
2. Pull only the support references needed for the specific files or boundaries involved.
3. Default to `test-first-development` whenever the behavior is testable.
4. Capture the failing test or failing reproduction signal before the main implementation pass.
5. If test-first is not practical, say why and name the fallback evidence path before editing code.
6. Default to plain ASCII in source code, comments, identifiers, test names, placeholder copy, and sample data. Do not add decorative icons, emojis, or unusual Unicode characters unless the existing repo or product content explicitly requires them.
7. Execute through `execution-loop` rather than piling unrelated changes into one pass.
8. Keep one behavior or fix slice per red-green cycle instead of widening scope during the green phase.
9. Preserve the active acceptance criteria and note any hidden scope discovered during implementation.
10. Hand off to `test-hub` or `qa-governor` with the evidence actually collected.

## Escalation
If implementation reveals missing architecture, unclear acceptance criteria, a bigger-than-expected change surface, or the need for parallel sub-work, stop and route back through `review-hub` or `workflow-router`.

## Role
- implementation

## Layer
- layer-4-specialists-and-standalones

## Inputs
- story or tech-spec
- project-context
- architecture when present
- relevant support references

## Outputs
- working code
- test evidence
- updated workflow-state or handoff note

## Reference skills and rules
- Use execution-loop as the execution engine.
- Pull in project-architecture, api-integration, data-persistence, and testing-patterns as needed.
- Hand off to test-hub or qa-governor; do not self-certify completion without evidence.
- Default to `test-first-development` whenever the change introduces or fixes behavior that can be exercised with a test or clear reproduction harness.
- If test-first is not practical, say why before coding and name the alternative failing signal you will use.
- Default to plain ASCII in source code, comments, identifiers, test names, placeholder copy, and sample data unless the repo or product explicitly requires non-ASCII content.
- If tasks are truly independent and the platform supports collaboration, follow `.relay-kit/docs/parallel-execution.md` before using subagent-style execution.

## Likely next step
- execution-loop
- test-hub
- qa-governor
- review-hub
